# Neural-Networks-from-Scratch

This aim of this object is to code our very own multi-layered perceptron model. or neural network, utilizing machine learning techniques such as activation functions, feedforward and back propogation algorithms. This model was then trained to detect network intrusion which it was able to do with up to 95% accuracy given our training set.
