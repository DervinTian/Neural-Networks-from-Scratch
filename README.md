# Neural-Networks-from-Scratch

This aim of this object is to code our very own multi-layered perceptron model. or neural network, utilizing machine learning techniques such as activation functions, feedforward and back propogation algorithms. This model was then trained to detect network intrusion which it was able to do with up to 95% accuracy given our database (too large to upload here).

## How it Works

Our program functions by having a structure of 4 basic types of layers. The first of which being the input layer, which in this case is the database. These inputs would get sent into our hidden layers, which performed operations and produced an output. However, this output was influenced by external factors, such as biases and weights which shift the output in a certain direction depending on the strength of our model.
